        "*   **Batch Processing and Incremental Saving**: The feature extraction process was successfully modified to handle images in batches of 5. Features were incrementally saved to a Parquet file named `extracted_image_features.parquet` by correctly using `append=True` with the `fastparquet` engine. The initial batch created the file, and subsequent batches successfully appended data.\n",
        "*   **Parallelization Strategy**: Parallel processing was introduced using Python's `multiprocessing.Pool` to extract features concurrently within each batch. The system utilized `os.cpu_count()` processes (e.g., 2 processes) for this task, significantly speeding up the extraction.\n",
        "*   **Progress Tracking**: The `tqdm` library was integrated into the batch processing loop, providing a visual progress bar (e.g., \"Extracting Features in Batches: 0%| | 0/28\") to monitor the extraction process, especially beneficial for large datasets.\n",

        "*   The implemented strategy of combining batch processing, parallelization, and incremental saving to Parquet files effectively addresses memory management, fault tolerance, and efficiency for large-scale image feature extraction.\n",

        "*   Encapsulating image listing logic, improving clarity and error handling for data preparation.\n",

        "*   Core functions like `fetch_image_urls`, `download_and_save_images`, `extract_noise_features`, `extract_all_features`, and `_extract_features_worker` were refactored into a single code block, with `extract_noise_features` specifically modified to return `np.nan` for all features if `cv2.imread` fails.\n",
        "*   A persistent Google Drive mounting issue (`ValueError: mount failed` and `FileNotFoundError`) was encountered during initial attempts to set up the `GDRIVE_SAVE_PATH`. This was successfully resolved by guiding the user through a manual troubleshooting process (restarting Colab runtime and re-executing cells).\n",

        "*   The main processing loop was successfully reorganized to perform batch processing of images (batch size of 5), parallel feature extraction using `multiprocessing.Pool` with 2 processes (determined by `os.cpu_count()`), and incremental saving of features to a Parquet file named `extracted_image_features.parquet` in the specified Google Drive path.\n",

        "*   **Fake Image Feature Loading:** Features for fake images were successfully loaded from `/content/drive/MyDrive/Unsplash_Images/Real_fake_image/test/FAKE/extracted_image_features.parquet`.\n",
        "*   **Conditional Real Image Feature Loading:** The system efficiently loaded 10,032 features for real images from an existing Parquet file at `/content/drive/MyDrive/Unsplash_Images/Real_fake_image/test/REAL/extracted_image_features.parquet`. This conditional check prevented redundant feature extraction, as the file already existed with the correct number of rows. The `real_features_df` had a shape of (10032, 12).\n",
        "*   **Dataset Combination:** Features from both fake and real images were combined, resulting in a combined feature matrix `X` with a shape of (20064, 11) and a label vector `y` with a shape of (20064,). This dataset comprised 10,032 fake images and 10,032 real images.\n",
        "*   **Model Training and Evaluation:**\n",
        "    *   The data was split into training (`X_train` shape: 19863, 11) and testing (`X_test` shape: 201, 11) sets using an 0.01 test size, ensuring class balance with stratification.\n",
        "    *   The trained Random Forest classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 0.83.\n",
        "    *   For identifying real images (Class 0.0), the model showed a precision of 0.83, recall of 0.84, and an F1-score of 0.83.\n",
        "    *   For identifying fake images (Class 1.0), the model showed a precision of 0.84, recall of 0.82, and an F1-score of 0.83.\n",
        "    *   The confusion matrix indicated 85 correctly classified real images, 82 correctly classified fake images, 16 real images misclassified as fake, and 18 fake images misclassified as real within the test set.\n",
        "*   **Model Persistence:** The trained Random Forest model was successfully saved to `/content/drive/MyDrive/Unsplash_Images/ai_detector_random_forest_model.pkl`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Performance Optimization:** The current model achieves a balanced accuracy of 83%. Investigate misclassified samples to identify patterns or challenging image characteristics that could inform feature engineering or model architecture improvements.\n",
        "*   **Model Generalization:** Evaluate the model's performance on a completely new, unseen dataset to assess its generalization capabilities beyond the current test set, especially with a larger test set (current test set is only 1% of the total data).\n"
