Features were incrementally saved to a Parquet file named `extracted_image_features.parquet` by correctly using `append=True` with the `fastparquet` engine. The initial batch created the file, and subsequent batches successfully appended data.\n",

        "*   **Progress Tracking**: The `tqdm` library was integrated into the batch processing loop, providing a visual progress bar (e.g., \"Extracting Features in Batches: 0%| | 0/28\") to monitor the extraction process, especially beneficial for large datasets.\n",

        "    Yes, an interactive form using `ipywidgets` was successfully implemented, featuring a file upload mechanism, image processing, feature extraction, and prediction display.\n",
        "*   **Does it allow image uploads?**\n",
        "    Yes, the `ipywidgets.FileUpload` widget is configured to accept PNG, JPG, and JPEG image files.\n",
        "*   **Does it provide accurate predictions using the Random Forest model?**\n",
        "    The implementation is designed to use the loaded Random Forest model for predictions. The accuracy of these predictions would need to be confirmed by testing the interactive form with actual images, which was not detailed in this solving process summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The `RandomForestClassifier` model, `ai_detector_random_forest_model.pkl`, was successfully loaded from `/content/drive/MyDrive/Unsplash_Images/ai_detector_random_forest_model.pkl` after initial troubleshooting regarding file availability.\n",
        "*   The loaded model was confirmed to be of type `<class 'sklearn.ensemble._forest.RandomForestClassifier'>`.\n",
        "*   An interactive prediction tool was successfully built using `ipywidgets`, incorporating a file upload feature (`ipywidgets.FileUpload`) and an output display area (`ipywidgets.Output`).\n",
        "*   The tool is designed to process uploaded images (PNG, JPG, JPEG), extract 11 features using an `extract_all_features` function, and predict whether an image is \"Real\" (0) or \"Fake\" (1) using the loaded Random Forest model, along with displaying confidence scores.\n",
        "*   `ipywidgets` library was confirmed to be ready for use, ensuring the interactive components could be rendered.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The interactive tool is ready for testing with various images to confirm its prediction accuracy and overall user experience.\n",
        "*   Consider adding more robust error handling or user feedback within the `on_upload_change` function, especially for cases where `extract_all_features` fails or returns `NaN` values, to guide users more effectively.\n"
